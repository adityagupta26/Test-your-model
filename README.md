# Test-your-model

The idea is to develop a utility that would allow anyone to create a demo web application give a machine learning model.

So, let's say I call the utility (from command-line) with my model and specify the task to be image classification, the utility would generate a simple website for me that would allow me to quickly test the model in nice way.

A sample usage would be 


```$ build_site --model my_model.h5 --task image_classification```


build_site is just a dummy name of the utility to be built.

The main aim of this utility will be to test any model by creating a website directly from the command line. The website should be designed in a way so that users can provide the 
input on the web and the predicted output should be shown on the website. 

#### Technolgies to use
You can use whatever tech you want including any opensource library or packages.

##### What to include in the proposal ?

Apart from your personal details and your experience. You should include the following in your proposal :-

- Your understanding of the project idea.
- Briefly explain the approach and mention the name of the technologies, you will use.
- Name the technologies you will use to make the website.
- Mockups and wireframes of the website.
